^ Blends are more economic to produce

^ Other examples, but this one is better

# Bottled in Bond?

- distilled in one season (calendar year)
- by one distiller at one distillery
- aged in a federally bonded warehouse for **4 years**
- bottled at 100 proof
- the label must identify the distillery

^ "Bottled in bond" is a result of the "Bottled in Bond Act of 1897

^ This was a consumer protection against producers blending unwanted stocks together and adjusting the color with iodine, tobacco, or other substances

^ Today "bottled in bond" is a mark of higher quality than standard offerings, see Jim Beam or Old Grandad. If you see it in the wild, give it a try

^ ”Peat moss” is the name typically given to the decomposed, dead remains of sphagnum moss, a plant native to many parts of the world. Gardeners tend to love it for its ability to retain water — it can often hold up to 20 times its weight.

^ It likes northern climates like Canada and Scotland

^ There's not a lot of forrest in the highlands, so it's used for fuel
