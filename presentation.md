# Bottled in Bond?

- distilled in one season (calendar year)
- by one distiller at one distillery
- aged in a federally bonded warehouse for **4 years**
- bottled at 100 proof
- the label must identify the distillery

^ "Bottled in bond" is a result of the "Bottled in Bond Act of 1897

^ This was a consumer protection against producers blending unwanted stocks together and adjusting the color with iodine, tobacco, or other substances

^ Today "bottled in bond" is a mark of higher quality than standard offerings, see Jim Beam or Old Grandad. If you see it in the wild, give it a try
